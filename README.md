# LSTM-from-Scratch
 Lecture material (codes, pdf). LSTM with numpy only

 Step-by-step description to build, test and run a LSTM ("many to many") based on the RNN package. 

## chapters
 1) building and testing a LSTM cell

 2) Backpropagation through time (BPTT)	

 3) full backpropagation

 4) modifying an optimizer (see chapter in "CNN-from-Scratch" for more details) with learning rate decay and momentum

 5) testing the LSTM and adding training & application to package, compare performance to RNN
